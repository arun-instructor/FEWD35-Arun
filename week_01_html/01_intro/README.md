##Overview of Front-End Web Development
- Front-end web development consists of writing code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- HTML is the structure of the page. It is the scaffold that adds various layout elements to your website.
- CSS is a set of style properties that give your page its look and feel. It gives HTML style.
- JavaScript adds interactivity to your pages and makes them dynamic. Think of dropdown menus, sliding and fading boxes, dynamic content reloading, etc.

##Overview of Back-End Web Development
- The back-end is a set of tools that enable the greater functionality of the website.
- Usually included in the back-end logic is database interaction.
- Here are a few examples of back-end languages:
	- Ruby
	- PHP
	- Python
	- C++

##How to Be a Professional Developer
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a tool that allows you to create versions of your project. It is highly used in the industry to save changes and also enable collaboration.
	- We will not be covering GitHub in this course, but I encourage you all to create an account and add each other.
	- GitHub is highly used to vet developers, so it's a good idea to get some street cred on it.
- Sublime Text is a fancy text editor that allows you to write code in many different languages. It helps you with syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and more.
- Frameworks:
	- Most developers use frameworks to help with projects.
	- Frameworks are pieces of software that are pre-written that help speed up the front-end web development process.
	- In this class we will learn the basics first, and then get into two frameworks to help you along.

##Front-End Taboo!
- Using the given cards, try to find two other matching peers that complement the frontend languages you now know of.
- For example - if your card says HTML, you are going to look for a person with a CSS card and another with a JavaScript card.
- **The catch is that you cannot tell anyone what your card says.**
- You have to rely on being able to explain in as much depth as you know what your language is.

##HTML Syntax
- Tags are elements on the page. Each have their own name and are enclosed by the caret syntax.

- Most tags have attributes that can add additional information to the element.

- How could we arrange this text in a layout that makes sense?
- Which HTML tags may we want to use here?

##In-Class Lab / Homework
- For this exercise we will be coding a simple cookie recipe.
- The starter code for this exercise is available on Schoology.
- In order to complete the assignment you will need to research the `<img>` tag.
