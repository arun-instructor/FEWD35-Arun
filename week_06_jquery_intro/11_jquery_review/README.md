#jQuery Review

##Review
- We will spend today reviewing jQuery.
- We will be going over the Divided Time exercise.

##Homework
- For homework you will be coding the game of TicTacToe from scratch.
- You will need to write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript yourself.
- Don't do any win checking. Simply make the game so that you can click on a space and it will alternate between X's and O's.
- Make sure to check that the space a user clicks on is not already taken.
- **Bonus:** Make it pretty using Bootstrap!
